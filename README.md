## Debouncing
Debouncing in React is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is executed, particularly in response to rapidly occurring events such as user input. It ensures that a function is only called after a specified delay has passed since the last time the event was triggered, preventing excessive or unnecessary function calls.
